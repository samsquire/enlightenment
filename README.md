It's just one big rectangle that you move things into and around one 64 bits at a time
I think it's amusing that stopping a processor is hard. The preempt problem.
RSP is just a number. Memory is just a rectangle of numbers. Flow can jump how we like. And where the stack is just a position in that rectangle.

# char ** strings = malloc(sizeof(char));

This needs to be `char ** strings = malloc(sizeof(char*));`

# key2, key3, copy pasted code

# you're looping past the structure

# your if statements might be preventing the state from being reached
